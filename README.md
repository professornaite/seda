## What is SEDA?

The Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA) is an initiative of the Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University. SEDA provides publicly available data files that include measures of academic achievement, achievement gaps, and school and neighborhood racial and socioeconomic composition and segregation, as well as other features of the U.S. education system. The data cover schools, school districts, counties, commuting zones, metropolitan areas, and states across the United States.

SEDA is designed to help researchers, policymakers, educators, and parents learn how to improve educational opportunity for all children. The archive includes detailed data on educational conditions, contexts, and outcomes, and can be used to generate evidence about what policies and contexts are most effective at increasing educational opportunity for students nationwide[1][5][6].
